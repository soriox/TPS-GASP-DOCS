# Rigging Firearms

The TPS Kit currently uses **Lyra weapon skeletons** and **Lyra reloading animations**. To ensure compatibility, weapons should be rigged to these skeletons to work seamlessly with existing animations.

## Important Notes

- **Use Lyra Weapon Skeletons** – This allows your weapon to work with Lyra’s animations without additional setup.
- **Different Skeletons Will Not Work** – If you rig a weapon to a different skeleton, the Lyra animations will not function correctly.

## Video Guide

This video is from the original TPS kit I created but the process is still exactly the same. This will actually even work with any Lyra related project.
