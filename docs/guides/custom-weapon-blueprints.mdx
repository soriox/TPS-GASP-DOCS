# Creating a Custom Weapon Blueprint

To create a weapon blueprint for the **Weapon System**, you need to have a **[rigged weapon](/guides/rigging-firearms)** and a **[weapon data asset](/weapon-system/data/weapon-data-bp)** ready. Make sure these are set up before proceeding.

## Choosing the Right Base Blueprint

Once your assets are ready, you can create a child blueprint based on one of the following:

- **Low-Level Functionality:**
  - **[Firearm_BP](/weapon-system/blueprints/firearm-bp)** (for firearms)
  - **[MeleeWeapon_BP](/weapon-system/blueprints/melee-bp)** (for melee weapons)

- **High-Level Functionality:**
  - **AssaultRifle_BP** or **Handgun_BP**, found in:
    ðŸ“‚ `/Game/TPSKit/Blueprints/Core/WeaponSystem/ChildBlueprints/`

## Important Variables

All weapon blueprints contain two key variables:

- **Ammo Data** â€“ Manages ammo count and extra clips.
- **Weapon Data** â€“ **Very important!** This is used to set the weapon's **data asset**, which defines all properties related to the weapon.

## Assigning the Weapon Data Asset

1. **Create the blueprint** based on a master blueprint.
2. **Assign the weapon data asset** inside the **Weapon Data** variable.
