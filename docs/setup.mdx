# Setup Guide

Setting up the **TPS Kit** is straightforward, as it is based on the **Game Animation Sample Project (GASP)** by Epic Games. Due to the complexity of GASP, migrating this kit to another project is **not recommended**. Simply download, extract, then open the project to start working.

## Folder Structure

To keep your work organized and avoid conflicts with existing assets, create a **dedicated folder** within your project:

1. Open your Unreal Engine project.
2. Navigate to the `Content` folder.
3. Create a new folder named `MyGame` (or a name of your game).
4. Place your custom blueprints and files in this new folder.

The important folders to **never touch** are the "TPSKit" and "GASP" folders inside of the project.

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Do not attempt to migrate to another project.** GASP is highly integrated, and moving the TPS Kit may lead to unexpected issues.
- ✅ **Work within a separate folder** to maintain organization and prevent conflicts.

## Next Steps

Once your folder structure is set up, you can start exploring the core features and integrating them into your workflow.
