# Weapon System

The **TPS Kit Weapon System** provides a fully modular and extensible framework for handling firearms and combat mechanics. Designed with flexibility in mind, this system allows developers to easily implement and customize weapons to fit various gameplay styles.

## Key Features

- 🔫 **Weapon Manager** – Handles weapon inventory, switching, and customization.
- 🎯 **Shooting Mechanics** – Includes hit detection, recoil, fire modes, and ballistics.
- 🔄 **Replication Support** – Fully synchronized in multiplayer environments.
- ⚙️ **Customization Ready** – Easily tweak weapon stats, attachments, and animations.

## How It Works

The **Weapon System** operates through a combination of **Weapon Manager**, **Weapon Components**, and **Gameplay Logic**, ensuring seamless interaction between weapons, animations, and character controls. Each weapon type (rifles, pistols, shotguns, etc.) is defined by modular components that can be extended or modified.

## Coming Soon

Still yet to come is more integration for melee weapons. For now, firearms are fully supported and replicated.
